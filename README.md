# basic-movie-recommender-system
have build an basic movie recommendation system 
1-Demographic Filtering
this are generalized recommendations to every user based on the popularity of the movie
2-Content Based Filtering
They suggest similar contect based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it. so it takes the similar content based of the users preferences(likes/dislikes) and suggests the further movies to the users
